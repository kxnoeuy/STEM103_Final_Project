# Magic Eight Ball
Koontzy Noeuy

Project Description: This program simulates a magic eight ball. The user asks a question in the terminal and the program will give a random response based on pre-written responses. The program will continue answering the user’s questions until the user no longer wants to continue. The first step in my project was outlining the algorithm I needed in order to give myself a general guideline on how the code would look like. The algorithm was fairly simple: Create a set of responses, prompt the user to ask a question, respond with a random response, ask again if the user wants to continue, and loop through until the user declines to continue. I used a list to create the list of responses, created a function that would return a random response from the list, then used while loops and if/else statements to ask the user for inputs. The new concept I explored was the random library, which returns a randomly selected element from my list of responses.
